			<h4>What We Do</h4>

			recently renovated in the past year or so. Stay at nice, fresh places

			<h4>How it Works</h4>
			<p>Founded in 2007, <em>Newsleeps!</em> gathers up information about
			which hotels have just opened, are opening soon,&nbsp;or &nbsp;have
			been recently renovated in about the last year or so old.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> because hotels and
			resorts may get unexpected delays in their exact opening dates, be sure
			to verify reservations before showing up! &nbsp;Just because a hotel
			announces it is open does not mean that they are really ready for
			business. <span style="font-style: italic;">Its always
			good to ask about construction first!</span></p>
			<p>Since <span style="font-style: italic;">Newsleeps!</span> can
			not actually visit every hotel listed, use your own judgement and do
			not try to hold us responsible. We only consolidate the information
			provided to us by the various hotels and resorts.</p>
			<p>Note that some hotels may say that they are brand new, but in reality,
			really are not. Unfortunately, we can not guarantee they are new.
			This is another good reason to give them a quick call to ask. We can
			only report on what they tell us, either via their web sites or other
			information sources.</p>
			<p>See reviews (in "Check Prices") to see what others have to say as well.</p>
