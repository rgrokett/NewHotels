			<p>You agree to abide by the terms or conditions of purchase imposed by any
third party with whom you elect to deal. Any third party that is an air
carrier may be required to make available to the public the terms of
its contract of carriage pursuant to Title 14, Part 253 of the Code of
Federal Regulations. The circumvention of an air carrier's rules,
including practices such as back-to-back ticketing (purchasing two or
more tickets with overlapping travel dates in order to circumvent
minimum stay requirements) and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing
tickets including segments which the purchaser does not intend to use
in order to circumvent an air carrier's pricing structure), is
prohibited by many air carriers. The use of prohibited ticketing
practices may result in the air carrier taking actions including the
cancellation of the ticket, denied boarding, revocation of frequent
flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the purchaser's
credit card, additional charges collected at the airport, or future
invoicing. You are responsible for ensuring that your purchases abide
by the terms or conditions of purchase imposed by any third party with
whom you elect to deal, including terms or condition of purchase set
forth in an air carrier's fare rules or contract of carriage.</p>

<p>Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to constitute either party as
the agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as
joint venturers or partners for any purpose. You may not assign,
delegate or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms. We
may assign our rights and duties under these Terms without such
assignment being considered a change to the Terms and without notice to
you. We may modify these Terms, at any time, by posting notice on this
Website at least ten (10) days before any modification becomes
effective. Your continued use of this Website following the posting of
notice of any modification will be subject the Terms in effect at the
time of your use. If you object to any provision of these Terms or any
subsequent modifications to these Terms or become dissatisfied with
this Website in any way, your only recourse is to immediately terminate

we fail to act with respect to your breach or anyone else's breach on
any occasion, we are not waiving our right to act with respect to
future or similar breaches. If a court finds any of these Terms to be
unenforceable or invalid, that Term will be enforced to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law and the other Terms will remain
valid and enforceable. These Terms, together with those agreements made
a part of these Terms by reference, make up the entire agreement
between us relating to your use of this Website, and replace any prior
