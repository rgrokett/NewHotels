			<h4>What is NewSleeps?</h4>
			<p>
			Founded in 2007, <em>NewSleeps</em> searches for hotels, resorts, motels, and any other places to stay
			that have opened or remodeled in the past year or so and makes the information
			available all in one place.
			</p>
          </div> 

          <div class="col-md-12 whiteboard">
			<h4>How do I know I get a good price if I use NewSleeps?</h4>
			<p>
			Though NewSleeps does offer to check prices and/or book rooms, when you click on a 
			hotel or resort name or photo, you are sent directly to their website where you can
			make your reservations with them, with the rates offered by that company.
			</p>
          </div>      

          <div class="col-md-12 whiteboard">
			<h4>Why should I use NewSleeps?</h4>
			<p>
			Why not? It's free. It's easy to use. If you like, book directly with the hotel.
			Don't you prefer nice new hotels to stay in?
          </div>

			<h4>Some hotels show Opening dates in the future!</h4>
			<p>
			Well, if you have future plans, you can see what may be opening then.
			Of course, be sure to check with the hotel (including calling them) if 
			their opening dates are very close to your travel time.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> because hotels and
			resorts may get unexpected delays in their exact opening dates, be sure
			to verify reservations before showing up! &nbsp;Just because a hotel
			announces it is open does not mean that they are really ready for
			business. <span style="font-style: italic;">Its always
			good to ask about construction first!</span></p>
          </div>      

          <div class="col-md-12 whiteboard">
			<h4>Is the hotel really nice?</h4>
			<p>Since <span style="font-style: italic;">Newsleeps</span> can
			not actually visit every hotel listed, use your own judgement and do
			not try to hold us responsible. We only consolidate the information
			provided to us by the various hotels and resorts.</p>
          </div>      

          <div class="col-md-12 whiteboard">
			<h4>Is the hotel really NEW?</h4>
			<p>Note that some hotels may say that they are brand new, but in reality,
			are not. Unfortunately, we can not guarantee they are new.
			This is another good reason to give them a quick call to ask. We can
			only report on what they tell us, either via their web sites or other
			information sources.</p>
			<p>See TripAdvisor reviews (in "Check Prices") to see what others have to say as well.</p>
