# NewHotels
Open source to the www.newsleeps.com website. Website of newly opened hotels. 

This is for learning purposes only. It is NOT a ready-to-run package!

See the README_NewHotels.doc for build details. 

NOTE! This is v0.1 as far as you may be concerned, due to the number of edits you will need in the .php files to fix paths, names, passwords. 

Guess what, you have to MANUALLY add new hotels to the admin/data/new_hotels.xls sheet! 

Requires PHP, Apache2, MariaDB.

Uses Google GEOMAP API to convert street addresses to Lat/Lng. You need a (free) license and update admin/data/geolocate.php

Security is minimal, but no customer data is collected.
